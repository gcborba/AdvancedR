# Warm-up exercise

Working individually, brainstorm two ways to calculate the mean of each column of this example data frame. Try to use a for loop for at least one of your options.

```{r test-matrix}
set.seed(47)
m <- data.frame(matrix(runif(1E5, max = 100), ncol = 100))



#Structure of a function:
#function(inputs){
# CODE HERE
#}

#Structure of a for loop:
#initialize output vector if needed
#for(index in 1:range){
# CODE HERE
#}
```

As a class, implement several options as functions. Make predictions as to which options will be fastest and why

```{r}
# OPTION 1: for loop with initialized output vector
loop_replace <- function(m) {
  means <- numeric(ncol(m)) #initialize output vector
  for (i in 1:ncol(m)) { #loop through indices 
    means[i] <- mean(m[[i]]) #calculate mean and put in output vector
  }
  means #return the now-complete output vector
}

# OPTION 2: built-in colMeans function
built_in <- function(m) {
  means <- colMeans(m) #built in function in R
  unname(means)
}

# OPTION 3: for loop that sequentially adds
loop_build <- function(m) {
  means <- c() #initialize empty output vector
  for (i in 1:ncol(m)) { #loop through indices 
    means <- c(means, mean(m[[i]])) #calculate mean and add to output vector
  }
  means #return the now-complete output vector
}

# OPTION 4: tidyverse
library(tidyverse) #load package
tidy <- function(m) {
  means <- m %>% #use pipe to pass the dataframe to the function
    summarize_all(mean) #use summarize_all function to calculate the mean of all columns
  as.numeric(means) #convert from data frame to vector
}

Check if outputs are the same with all approaches


identical(loop_replace(m),
          built_in(m),
          loop_build(m),
          tidy(m))
# TRUE indicates all are the sameâ€”these four approaches return the same output
```


Use the `microbenchmark` package to compare the speed of these options

```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
compare <- microbenchmark(loop_replace(m),
                          built_in(m),
                          loop_build(m),
                          tidy(m),
                          times = 100
                          )
ggplot2::autoplot(compare)
```

## Discussion questions

* What factors make these approaches more and less efficient? 
* Do you expect the same patterns with larger datasets? Smaller datasets?
* In your own work, have there been times where code efficiency was a concern? If so, what have you done to address this concern?
* Aside from efficiency, what factors may make some of these options better than others?
