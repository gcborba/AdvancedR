# Functions

This document is modified from Chapter 2 of [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/memory.html) by Hadley Wickham (second edition; licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

## Why functions

By this point, you are probably already very familiar with using functions that other people have written (i.e., functions built into R and in R packages). Being able to write your own functions will help you reduce duplication in your code and isolate separate components of your data analysis workflow. This unit provides an in-depth exploration of how functions work in R.

### Example

Generate two sample datasets
```{r}
set.seed(1014) # Set seed controls random number generation, allowing for consistent results
# 1 Generate dataset with -99 as NA
df1 <- data.frame(replicate(6, sample(c(1:10, -99), 6, rep = TRUE))) 
names(df1) <- letters[1:6] # Assign column names
# 2 Generate dataset with -999 as NA
df2 <- data.frame(replicate(6, sample(c(1:10, -999), 6, rep = TRUE))) # Generate dataset
names(df2) <- letters[1:6] # Assign column names
```

Switch numeric missing values to NA
```{r}
# OPTION 1: brute force

# OPTION 2: For loops

# OPTION 3: function

```

### Function components

A function has three parts: 

* The `formals()`, the list of arguments that control how you call the function.
  
* The `body()`, the code inside the function.

* The `environment()`, the data structure that determines how the function finds 
the values associated with the names.

While the formals and body are specified explicitly when you create a function, the environment is specified implicitly, based on _where_ you defined the function. The function environment always exists, but it is only printed when the function isn't defined in the global environment.

```{r}
f02 <- function(x, y) {
  # A comment
  x + y
}

formals(f02)

body(f02)

environment(f02)
```

You can view the source code for non-primitive functions in R by printing the function as an object. The `getAnywhere()` function is helpful when you don't know which namespace a function is in.

```{r}
cor # non-primitive function

sum # primitive function

getAnywhere("cor") # alternative way of accessing source code
```

### Exercises

1. Let's practice writing functions! Write a function to calculate the standard deviation of a vector. Recall that standard deviation is the square root of the variance of the data. 

```{r}
data <- c(1, 5, 2, 6, 8, 4, 2, 6, 7)
#STEP 1: First, calculate the standard deviation of these data outside of a function (without using the built-in `sd()` function)

#STEP 2: Now, paste that code in the body of the function.
stdev <- function (data) {
  # BODY
}

#STEP 3: Run your function!
stdev(data)

#STEP 4: Confirm that this function returns the same result as the built-in sd function
stdev(data) == sd(data)
```

2. Now examine the code for the built in `sd()` function. How did your solution differ? Why?

```{r}

```

### Diagrams: functions as first-class objects

We will draw functions as in the following diagram. The black dot on the left is the environment. The two blocks to the right are the function arguments. I won't draw the body, because it's usually large, and doesn't help you understand the shape of the function.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("../diagrams/functions/components.png")
```

R functions are objects in their own right, a language property often called "first-class functions". 

Unlike in many other languages, there is no special syntax for defining and naming a function: you simply create a function object (with `function`) and bind it to a name with `<-`:

```{r}
f01 <- function(x) {
  sin(1 / x ^ 2)
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("../diagrams/functions/first-class.png")
```

While you almost always create a function and then bind it to a name, the binding step is not compulsory. If you choose not to give a function a name, you get an __anonymous function__, which you can use within other functions

In R, you'll often see functions called __closures__. This name reflects the fact that R functions capture, or enclose, their environments.

### Primitive functions

There is one exception to the rule that a function has three components. Primitive functions, like `sum()` and `[`, call C code directly. 

```{r}
sum
`[` #Yes, a bracket is a function! We will talk about this more later
```

They have either type `builtin` or type `special`.

```{r}
typeof(sum) #builtin
typeof(`[`) #special
typeof(cor) #closure --> remember closure means function!
typeof() #what about f2 (created above)?
```

Primitive functions exist primarily in C, not R, so their `formals()`, `body()`, and `environment()` are all `NULL`:  

Primitive functions are only found in the base package, and they have certain performance advantages.

## Function forms

> To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:
>
> * Everything that exists is an object.
> * Everything that happens is a function call.
>
> --- John Chambers

While everything that happens in R is a result of a function call, not all calls look the same. Function calls come in four varieties:

* __prefix__: the function name comes before its arguments, like
  `foofy(a, b, c)`. These constitute of the majority of function calls in R.

* __infix__: the function name comes in between its arguments, like
  `x + y`. Infix forms are used for many mathematical operators, and for
  user-defined functions that begin and end with `%`.

* __replacement__: functions that replace values by assignment, like
  `names(df) <- c("a", "b", "c")`. They actually look like prefix functions.

* __special__: functions like `[[`, `if`, and `for`. While they don't have a
  consistent structure, they play important roles in R's syntax.

While there are four forms, you actually only need one because any call can be written in prefix form. I'll demonstrate this property, and then you'll learn about each of the forms in turn.

### Prefix form

The prefix form is the most common form in R code, and indeed in the majority of programming languages. Prefix calls in R are a little special because you can specify arguments in three ways:

* By position, like `help(mean)`.
* Using partial matching, like `help(top = mean)`.
* By name, like `help(topic = mean)`.

As illustrated by the following chunk, arguments are matched by exact name, then with unique prefixes, and finally by position.

```{r, error = TRUE}
k01 <- function(formal_one, formal_two, formal_three) {
  list(a = formal_one, b1 = formal_two, b2 = formal_three)
}
# Position
str(k01(1, 2, 3))

# Exact name
str(k01(2, 3, formal_one = 1))

# Partial matching (not recommended)
str(k01(2, 3, formal_o = 1))
# Partial matching fails (ambiguous)
str(k01(1, 3, formal_t = 1))
```

In general, use positional matching only for the first one or two arguments; they will be the most commonly used, and most readers will know what they are. 

Avoid using positional matching for less commonly used arguments, and never use partial matching. Unfortunately you can't disable partial matching, but you can turn it into a warning with the `warnPartialMatchArgs` option:

```{r}
options(warnPartialMatchArgs = TRUE)
x <- k01(formal_o = 1, 2, 3)
```

### Infix functions

Infix functions get their name from the fact the function name comes inbetween its arguments, and hence have two arguments. R comes with a number of built-in infix operators: `:`, `::`, `:::`, `$`, `@`, `^`, `*`, `/`, `+`, `-`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `!`, `&`, `&&`, `|`, `||`, `~`, `<-`, and `<<-`. You can also create your own infix functions that start and end with `%`. Base R uses this pattern to define `%%`, `%*%`, `%/%`, `%in%`, `%o%`, and `%x%`.

Defining your own infix function is simple. You create a two argument function and bind it to a name that starts and ends with `%`:

```{r}
`%+%` <- function(a, b) paste0(a, b)
"new " %+% "string"
```

R's default precedence rules mean that infix operators are composed left to right:

```{r}
`%-%` <- function(a, b) paste0("(", a, " %-% ", b, ")")
"a" %-% "b" %-% "c"
```

### Replacement functions 

Replacement functions act like they modify their arguments in place, and have the special name `xxx<-`. They must have arguments named `x` and `value`, and must return the modified object. For example, the following function modifies the second element of a vector: 

```{r}
`second<-` <- function(x, value) {
  x[2] <- value
  x
}
```

Replacement functions are used by placing the function call on the left side of `<-`: 

```{r}
x <- 1:10
second(x) <- 5L
x

# L makes it an integer, takes up less memory because otherwise r default will think that is may have decimals
```

I say they act like they modify their arguments in place, because, as explained in our Memory unit, they actually create a modified copy. We can see that by using our old friend `tracemem()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- 1:10
tracemem(x)

second(x) <- 6L
```

If your replacement function needs additional arguments, place them between `x` and `value`, and call the replacement function with additional arguments on the left:

```{r}
`modify<-` <- function(x, position, value) {
  x[position] <- value
  x
}
# x is currently c(1, 6, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
modify(x, 1) <- 10
x
```

When you write `modify(x, 1) <- 10`, behind the scenes R turns it into:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- `modify<-`(x, 1, 10)
```

### Special forms

Finally, there are a bunch of language features that are usually written in special ways, but also have prefix forms. These include parentheses:

* `(x)` (`` `(`(x) ``)
* `{x}` (`` `{`(x) ``).

The subsetting operators:

* `x[i]` (`` `[`(x, i) ``) 
* `x[[i]]` (`` `[[`(x, i) ``)

And the tools of control flow:

* `if (cond) true` (`` `if`(cond, true) ``)
* `if (cond) true else false` (`` `if`(cond, true, false) ``)
* `for(var in seq) action` (`` `for`(var, seq, action) ``)
* `while(cond) action` (`` `while`(cond, action)  ``)
* `repeat expr` (`` `repeat`(expr) ``)
* `next` (`` `next`() ``)
* `break` (`` `break`() ``)

Finally, the most complex is the `function` function:

* `function(arg1, arg2) {body}` (`` `function`(alist(arg1, arg2), body, env)``)

Knowing the name of the function that underlies a special form is useful for getting documentation: `?(` is a syntax error; `` ?`(` `` will give you the documentation for parentheses.

### Rewriting to prefix form

Every infix, replacement, or special form can be rewritten in prefix form. Doing so is useful because it helps you better understand the structure of the language, it gives you the real name of every function, and it allows you to modify those functions for fun and profit.

The following example shows three pairs of equivalent calls, rewriting an infix form, replacement form, and a special form into prefix form. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
### 
x <- 1
y <- 2
#Infix form
x + y
#Prefix form:

###
df <- data.frame(matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 3))
#Replacement form
names(df) <- c("x", "y", "z")
#Prefix form for assignment
`names<-`(df, c("x", "y", "z")) 
df #df is unchanged, because there is really another step here
```

Surprisingly, in R, `for` can be called like a regular function! The same is true for basically every operation in R.

```{r}
for(i in 1:10) print(i)
`for`(i, 1:10, print(i))
```

Because things like `+`, `(`, and `<-` are functions, what they do can be changed!

If you're ever feeling particularly evil, run the following code while a friend is away from their computer. It will introduce a fun bug: 10% of the time, it will add 1 to any numeric calculation inside the parentheses.

```{r}
`(` <- function(e1) {
  if (is.numeric(e1) && runif(1) < 0.1) {
    e1 + 1
  } else {
    e1
  }
}
replicate(50, (1 + 2))
rm("(") #Undo
```

A more useful application comes up when using functional programming tools. For example, you could use `lapply()` to add 3 to every element of a list by relying on the existing `+` function:

```{r}
lapply(list(1:3, 4:5), `+`, 3)
```

## Exiting a function

Most functions exit in one of two ways: they either return a value, indicating success, or they throw an error, indicating failure. This section describes return values (implicit versus explicit; visible versus invisible), briefly discusses errors, and introduces exit handlers, which allow you to run code when a function exits.

### Implicit versus explicit returns

There are two ways that a function can return a value:

*   Implicitly, where the last evaluated expression is the return value:

```{r}
plus_1 <- function(x) {
  x + 1
}

plus_1() #test
```

*   Explicitly, by calling `return()`:

```{r}
plus_1_return <- function(x) {
  output <- x + 1
  return(output)
}

plus_1_return() #test
```

### Errors

If a function cannot complete its assigned task, it should throw an error with `stop()`, which immediately terminates the execution of the function.

```{r, error = TRUE}
j05 <- function() {
  stop("I'm an error")
  # can also do warning or message
  return(10)
}

j05()
```

An error indicates that something has gone wrong, and forces the user to deal with the problem. Some languages (like C, Go, and Rust) rely on special return values to indicate problems, but in R you should always throw an error. 

### Exit handlers

Sometimes a function needs to make temporary changes to the global state. But having to cleanup those changes can be painful (what happens if there's an error?). To ensure that these changes are undone and that the global state is restored no matter how a function exits, use `on.exit()` to set up an __exit handler__. The following simple example shows that the exit handler is run regardless of whether the function exits normally or with an error.

```{r, error = TRUE}
j06 <- function(x) {
  cat("Hello\n")
  on.exit(cat("Goodbye!\n"), add = TRUE)
  
  if (x) {
    return(10)
  } else {
    stop("Error")
  }
}

j06(TRUE)

j06(FALSE)
```

`on.exit()` is useful because it allows you to place clean-up code directly next to the code that requires clean-up:

```{r}
cleanup <- function(dir, code) {
  old_dir <- setwd(dir)
  on.exit(setwd(old_dir), add = TRUE)
  
  old_opt <- options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  on.exit(options(old_opt), add = TRUE)
}
```

See Advanced R textbook for more information on errors/error handlers

### Exercises

1.  What does `write.table()` return? What would be more useful?

2.  How does the `chdir` parameter of `source()` compare to `with_dir()`? Why 
    might you prefer one to the other?

3.  Write a function that opens a graphics device, runs the supplied code, and 
    closes the graphics device (always, regardless of whether or not the 
    plotting code works).

## Lexical scoping

Here we'll discuss __scoping__, the act of finding the value associated with a name.

For example, what will the following code return, 10 or 20?

```{r, results = "hide"}
x <- 10
g01 <- function() {
  x <- 20
  x
}

g01()
```

In this section, you'll learn the formal rules of scoping. 

A deeper understanding of scoping will help you to use more advanced functional programming tools, and eventually, even to write tools that translate R code into other languages.

### Environments

To understand scoping, it is helpful to have a general awareness of environments in R

The job of an environment is to associate, or __bind__, a set of names to a set of values. You can think of an environment as a bag of names, with no implied order (i.e. it doesn't make sense to ask which is the first element in an environment). For that reason, we'll draw the environment as so:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/bindings.png")
```

### Lexical scoping

R uses __lexical scoping__: it looks up the values of names based on how a function is defined, not how it is called. 

__Parent__ environments are what is used to implement lexical scoping. Every environment has a __parent__, another environment.

If a name is not found in an environment, then R will look in its parent (and so on).  You can set the parent environment by supplying an unnamed argument to `env()`. If you don't supply it, it defaults to the current environment. In the code below, `e2a` is the parent of `e2b`.

In diagrams, the parent is shown as a small pale blue circle and arrow that points to another environment.

```{r}
e2a <- env(d = 4, e = 5)
e2b <- env(e2a, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/environments/parents.png")
```

Each package attached by `library()` or `require()` becomes one of the parents of the global environment. The immediate parent of the global environment is the last package you attached, the parent of that package is the second to last package you attached, ... 

To save space, I typically won't draw all the ancestors; just remember whenever you see a pale blue circle, there's a parent environment somewhere. 

You can find the parent of an environment with `env_parent()`:

```{r}
env_parent(e2b)
env_parent(e2a)
```

R's lexical scoping follows four primary rules:

* Name masking
* Functions versus variables
* A fresh start
* Dynamic lookup

### Name masking

The basic principle of lexical scoping is that names defined inside a function mask names defined outside a function. This is illustrated in the following example.

```{r}
x <- 10
y <- 20
g02 <- function() {
  x <- 1
  y <- 2
  c(x, y)
}
g02()
```

If a name isn't defined inside a function, R looks one level up.

```{r}
x <- 2
g03 <- function() {
  y <- 1
  c(x, y)
}
g03()

# And this doesn't change the previous value of y
y
```

### Functions versus variables

When a function and a non-function share the same name (they must, of course, reside in different environments), applying these rules gets a little more complicated. When you use a name in a function call, R ignores non-function objects when looking for that value. For example, in the code below, `g09` takes on two different values:

```{r}
g09 <- function(x) x + 100
g10 <- function() {
  g09 <- 10
  g09(g09)
}
g10()
```

For the record, using the same name for different things is confusing and best avoided!

### A fresh start

What happens to values between invocations of a function? Consider the example below. What will happen the first time you run this function? What will happen the second time? 

```{r, results = "hide"}
g11 <- function() {
  #`exists()` returns `TRUE` if there's a variable with that name and returns `FALSE` if not
  if (!exists("a")) {
    a <- 1
  } else {
    a <- a + 1
  }
  a
}

g11()
g11()
```

Every time a function is called a new environment is created to host its execution. This means that a function has no way to tell what happened the last time it was run; each invocation is completely independent. 

### Dynamic lookup

Lexical scoping determines where, but not when to look for values. R looks for values when the function is run, not when the function is created. Together, these two properties tell us that the output of a function can differ depending on the objects outside the function's environment:

```{r}
g12 <- function() {x + 1}
x <- 15
g12()

#What if we change x?
```

This behaviour can be quite annoying. If you make a spelling mistake in your code, you won't get an error message when you create the function. And depending on the variables defined in the global environment, you might not even get an error message when you run the function. 

To detect this problem, use `codetools::findGlobals()`. This function lists all the external dependencies (unbound symbols) within a function:

```{r}
codetools::findGlobals(g12)
```

To solve this problem, you can manually change the function's environment to the `emptyenv()`, an environment which contains nothing:

```{r, error = TRUE}
environment(g12) <- emptyenv()
g12()
```

The problem and its solution reveal why this seemingly undesirable behaviour exists: R relies on lexical scoping to find _everything_, from the obvious, like `mean()`, to the less obvious, like `+` or even `{`. This gives R's scoping rules a rather beautiful simplicity.

### Exercises

1. What does the following code return? Why? Describe how each of the three
   `c`'s is interpreted.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
c <- 10
c(c = c)
```

2. What are the four principles that govern how R looks for values?

3. What does the following function return? Make a prediction before 
   running the code yourself.

```{r, results = "hide"}
f <- function(x) {
  f <- function(x) {
    f <- function() {
      x ^ 2
    }
    f() + 1
  }
  f(x) * 2
}
f(10)
```

## Lazy evaluation

In R, function arguments are __lazily evaluated__: they're only evaluated if accessed. For example, this code doesn't generate an error because `x` is never used:

```{r}
h01 <- function(x) {
  10
}
h01(stop("This is an error!"))
```

This is an important feature because it allows you to do things like include potentially expensive computations in function arguments that will only be evaluated if needed.

### Default arguments

Thanks to lazy evaluation, default values can be defined in terms of other arguments, or even in terms of variables defined later in the function:

```{r}
h04 <- function(x = 1, y = x * 2, z = a + b) {
  a <- 10
  b <- 100
  
  c(x, y, z)
}

h04()
```

Many base R functions use this technique, but I don't recommend it. It makes the code harder to understand: to predict _what_ will be returned, you need to know the exact order in which default arguments are evaluated.

The evaluation environment is slightly different for default and user supplied arguments, as default arguments are evaluated inside the function. This means that seemingly identical calls can yield different results. It's easiest to see this with an extreme example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
h05 <- function(x = ls()) {
  a <- 1
  x
}

# ls() evaluated inside h05:
h05()
#> [1] "a" "x"

# ls() evaluated in global environment:
h05(ls())
#> [1] "h05"
```

### Exercises

1.  What important property of `&&` makes `x_ok()` work?

```{r}
x_ok <- function(x) {
  !is.null(x) && length(x) == 1 && x > 0
}

x_ok(NULL)
x_ok(1)
x_ok(1:3)
```

What is different with this code? Why is this behaviour undesirable here?
    
```{r}
x_ok <- function(x) {
  !is.null(x) & length(x) == 1 & x > 0
}

x_ok(NULL)
x_ok(1)
x_ok(1:3)
```
    
2.  What does this function return? Why? Which principle does it illustrate?

```{r, results = "hide"}
f2 <- function(x = z) {
  z <- 100
  x
}
f2()
```

3.  What does this function return? Why? Which principle does it illustrate?
  
```{r, results = "hide"}
y <- 10
f1 <- function(x = {y <- 1; 2}, y = 0) {
  c(x, y)
}
f1()
y
```
  
4.  In `hist()`, the default value of `xlim` is `range(breaks)`, the default 
    value for `breaks` is `"Sturges"`, and

```{r}
range("Sturges")
```
    
Explain how `hist()` works to get a correct `xlim` value.
    
5.  Explain why this function works. Why is it confusing?

```{r}
show_time <- function(x = stop("Error!")) {
  stop <- function(...) Sys.time()
  print(x)
}
show_time()
```

## `...`  (dot-dot-dot)

Functions can have a special argument `...` (pronounced dot-dot-dot). With it, a function can take any number of additional arguments. In other programming languages, this type of argument is often called _varargs_ (short for variable arguments), and a function that uses it is said to be variadic. 

You can also use `...` to pass those additional arguments on to another function.

```{r}
i01 <- function(y, z) {
  list(y = y, z = z)
}

i02 <- function(x, ...) {
  i01(...)
}

str(i02(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3))
```

For an example of where `...` may be useful, consider `lapply()`. Here, `lapply()` uses `...` to pass `na.rm` on to `mean()`:
    
```{r}
x <- list(c(1, 3, NA), c(4, NA, 6))
str(lapply(x, mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Using `...` comes with two downsides:

*   When you use it to pass arguments to another function, you have to 
    carefully explain to the user where those arguments go. This makes it
    hard to understand what you can do with functions like `lapply()` and 
    `plot()`.
    
*   A misspelled argument will not raise an error. This makes it easy for 
    typos to go unnoticed:

```{r}
sum(1, 2, NA, na_rm = TRUE)
```

### Exercises

1.  Explain the following results:
    
```{r}
sum(1, 2, 3)
mean(1, 2, 3)

sum(1, 2, 3, na.omit = TRUE)
mean(1, 2, 3, na.omit = TRUE)
```

2.  Explain how to find the documentation for the named arguments in the 
    following function call:
    
```{r, fig.asp = 1, small_mar = TRUE, fig.width = 3}
plot(1:10, col = "red", pch = 20, xlab = "x", col.lab = "blue")
```
    
3.  Why does `plot(1:10, col = "red")` only colour the points, not the axes 
    or labels? Read the source code of `plot.default()` to find out.

### Invoking a function

You normally call a function by placing its arguments, wrapped in parentheses, after its name: `mean(1:10, na.rm = TRUE)`. But what happens if you have the arguments already in a data structure?

```{r}
args <- list(1:10, na.rm = TRUE)
```

You can instead use `do.call()`: it has two arguments. The function to call, and a list containing the function arguments:

```{r}
do.call(mean, args)

1. Rewrite the following code snippets into prefix form:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
1 + 2 + 3

1 + (2 + 3)

if (length(x) <= 5) x[[5]] else x[[n]]
```

2.  Clarify the following list of odd function calls:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- sample(replace = TRUE, 20, x = c(1:10, NA))
y <- runif(min = 0, max = 1, 20)
cor(m = "k", y = y, u = "p", x = x)
```


3. Explain why the following code fails:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
modify(get("x"), 1) <- 10
#> Error: target of assignment expands to non-language object
```

4. Create a replacement function that modifies a random location in a vector.

5. Write your own version of `+` that pastes its inputs together if they are 
   character vectors but behaves as usual otherwise. In other words, make this 
   code work:
   
```{r, eval = FALSE}
1 + 2
#> [1] 3

"a" + "b"
#> [1] "ab"
```

6. Create a list of all the replacement functions found in the base package. 
   Which ones are primitive functions? (Hint: use `apropos()`.)

7. What are valid names for user-created infix functions?

8. Create an infix `xor()` operator.

9. Create infix versions of the set functions `intersect()`, `union()`, and
   `setdiff()`. You might call them `%n%`, `%u%`, and `%/%` to match 
   conventions from mathematics.
