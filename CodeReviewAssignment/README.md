# AdvancedR
This code is for the Advanced R Code Review assignment. The data I am using is from a previous master student of Dr. Entrekin in Entomology, Ary James. 
She worked on some of the same streams as me studying macroinvertebrate communities in different salinities, which I will be doing as well but with a lens on secondary production.
Dr. Entrekin provided me with this data to practice with in my quantitative ecology class, since it will be similar to what my data will be structured like.
Where I am at is a pretty beginner stage working on creating ordinations. I have some questions annotated in my code that I am still working out, so if you know the answer, let me know!
