# AdvancedR
This code is for the Advanced R Code Review assignment. The data I am using is from a previous master student of Dr. Entrekin in Entomology, Ary James. 
She worked on some of the same streams as me studying macroinvertebrate communities in different salinities, which I will be doing as well but with a lens on secondary production.
This project is known among collaborators as the NSF Salty Carbon Project and has many sites along a mining-induced salinity gradient. Dr. Entrekin provided me with this data to practice with in my quantitative ecology class, since it will be similar to what my data will be structured like. Where I am at is a pretty beginner stage working on creating ordinations. I have some questions annotated in my code that I am still working out, so if you know the answer, let me know!
To run the analysis, following along with the code should be all that is needed. Steps in the NMDS are explained along the way. The csv in the folder will likely have to be downloaded and a new working directory set on your R Studio.
